This is a laucher only for Open Source Mediacenter (OSMC), the launcher installs two scripts that run and handles Steamlink, remember this is all beta so report performance issues to Valve and launcher issues here, i will not handle performance issues at all will refer to Valve for that.

## Installation

* download the [zip](https://github.com/swetoast/steamlink-launcher/releases) of the launcher and install it via Kodi
* the addon installs Steamlink automatically, wakeuponlan is also supported if its installed all you have to do is create a file in home directory called .wakeup and add your MAC id `nano /home/osmc/.wakeup`
* This addon needs Kodi version **19** to be installed since its **python 3**.

## Got issues

* if the bug is related to the launcher, file an issue
* if its related to OSMC like crashing the pi adding overlays etc start a thread on OSMC Forums.
* if steamlink launches but there are issues then go to [Steam Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/) for support.

this makes it less spammy on the issue tracker with OSMC issues again this launcher does very little on a OS level all it does is starts steamlink.

When reporting a bug please prodvide logs this can be done via commandline `grab-logs -A` 

if these fixes are out of date and its working report back on the tracker.

### Known Workarounds:

* if you get a black stream from your Steam host, you need `dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d,cma-512` instead of `dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d` in `config.txt` this workaround is for Raspberry Pi 4 (only)
